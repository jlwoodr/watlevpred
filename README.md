Water Level Visualization 

Best way to do this is to download both the code and data files along with the ArcMap .mxd file. This is because the arcmap toolbox uses relative paths to grab the DEMs, code, etc.

For DEMs I recommend going to NOAA digital coast webiste and finding appropirate bathy/topo .tifs to run the code on. For best results try to find small DEMs that surround the station you would like to extract the water levels from. This will keep ArcMap from crashing. Follow the following link to the DEMs that I downloaded.
